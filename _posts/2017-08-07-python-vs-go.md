[Python](https://python.org/) is a widely popular and diverse programming language. Along with Java, JavaScript and C, Python is one of the most spoken languages in the coding industry today.

Most importantly, Python is one the easiest programming languages to learn, use and find a job with. In fact, Python’s versatility and success has made it a big competitor to other coding languages.

But what about [Go](https://golang.com/)?

Every Go developer will agree that there are pros and cons to each language, but which is better for your career: Python or Go?
Why use Python?

Python was designed by Dutch programmer Guido van Rossum in 1991.

* Easy to read

The language was designed t*o be easy-to-read. The syntax and code is often shorter than other languages.

* Object-oriented language

Like C++ or Java. Van Rossum’s goal was to make the language extensible without needing to use “excessive amounts of code.

* Powerful programming language

For building applications that solve complex issues and create compelling experiences. Whether your business needs to connect multiple systems, collect real-time data from devices or provide a GUI to access your information, Python can accomplish it all.
Why Go is great?

* Easy to learn

First, it's easy to pick up. The language is small and the way it works is conceptually very simple.

Go is a simple, powerful and efficient language. Think of it as the perfect programmer's tool. The goal of Go is to reduce boilerplate and provide the tools for you to get the job done.

* Concurrent programming and binaries

It produces small binaries which make it ideal for systems programming. Go is also great for concurrent programming; goroutines make writing programs that do many things at once incredibly easy.

Go compiles quickly to machine code yet has the convenience of garbage collection and the power of run-time reflection. It's a fast, statically typed, compiled language that feels like a dynamically typed, interpreted language.

* Go has a great community

There's an active mailing list and a large number of books, blogs, and conferences talking about Go.
Python or Go?

The TL;DR version: "People who use Python tend to love it, people who use Go tend to love it too".

* Why do people use Python?

There are some reasons people start programming with Python. The first is that it's easy. It has an interpreter available that you can run in a shell.

Just pip install some libraries and you can start typing out code to do things right away.

You don't need to compile anything, there's no requirements.txt file to maintain, no breaking changes happening because of library updates, none of that stuff. You just run the interpreter and start typing away.

For linux users it may not come as a surprise but most of the major distros have python interpreter inbuilt.

* Why do people use Go?

Go is a powerful language that can be used to build an amazing, scalable application.

Lets look at the top reasons why you’ll want to start building your next app in Go

    It’s Fast
    It’s Easy to Understand
    It’s Fun to Use
    Your Coding Friends Will Love You
    It Has a Great Ecosystem
    Its Open Source

Bonus Reason: You Can Use Go On The Web!

So, If you are looking for a new language as a developer or product manager you will want to consider giving Go a chance but if want to play safe, well python is python!
