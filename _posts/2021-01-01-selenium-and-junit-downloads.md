## Steps to Download Selenium

1. Select Language Specific Download link Since, this is java based tutorial I will select Java link.

If you are beginner I recommend downloading stable releases move towards beta releases as you gain experience you can play around with beta packages as they generally have a few more perks and to be released features.

2. If you are going to automate browsers such as Chrome or FireFox I recommend you download one of these browser specific driver.

Selenium also includes a non-gui browser but as name suggests it does not contain any graphical user interface and it won't be of much use or fun for a beginner.

3. Check your Chrome Browser version and Download ChromeDriver file accordingly.

File is in zip format and you'll get ChromeDriver.exe after you extract it. Please Remember PATH of extracted file because you'll most definitly need it when coding test cases.

4. Select OS specific version

I am Downloading Windows Version because I'm currently on Windows machine.
