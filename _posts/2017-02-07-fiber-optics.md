Fiber optics is a method of transmitting data in form of light signals (light pulses) through optical fiber cables. Fiber optics is major, modern & most efficient way to transmit data at high speed.


**What is the maximum speed which can be achieved on optical fiber?**
Researchers at Bell Labs have reached internet speeds of over 100 petabit×kilometer per second using fiber-optic communication. You might be wondering how much is a petabit
```
1 petabit = 125000 gigabytes
```
Yes! That many GBs..

Internet providers like Google use same tech to give high speed internet upto 1 Gbps.

**Applications**
==Interconnects== : Typical interconnect products are centered on a variety of industry standard cable assemblies that move, relay, or distribute data from point-to-point. Often this link, or connection, is very short for applications like switch-to-switch, switch-to-patch panel, and server-to-server. However, interconnects can also be rather long, linking two network or telecommunications closets on an inter-building campus.

==Oil & Gas industry== : Fiber optics for oil and gas are used as a communications conduit or as a sensor communication/control link. For communications, fiber optics offer a large amount of bandwidth in a compact package, saving space, weight, and install time. With sensor applications, fiber optics can provide a wide range of data about environmental conditions, oil reserve levels, and equipment performance or status.

==HDTV== : HDTV is a very bandwidth intensive application requiring maximum allowable speed and data volume transfer. Service providers and production companies are utilizing fiber optics as the support and distribution structure all the way to the subscriber.

==Imaging== : Fiber optic imaging uses the optical transmission properties of fiber to transmit an image from end to end. To accomplish this, most imaging applications use an image guide or coherent bundle to collect an image of the target or subject area, then relays that information to the view end for interpretation.

It is very useful in medical applications.

There are many other applications of fiber optics such as in military, networking, aerospace industry, unmanned aircrafts (UAVs), data storage equipments, automotive industry, etc.

Don’t get confused with terms fiber optics & optical fiber, fiber optics is way of communication using pulses of light through optical fibers & optical fibers are thin tube like flexible strands made of glass or plastic. Optical fibers are as thin as hair.
